# Matrix Build Demo

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow demonstrating a matrix build that produces artifacts.

What it does
- Runs a matrix build across Node.js versions: 14, 16, 18 (three parallel jobs).
- Each job generates a small non-empty artifact (`output.txt`) containing the build output and metadata.
- Each artifact is uploaded and named with the prefix `build-9a65b33-` (e.g. `build-9a65b33-v14`).
- The workflow includes a step identifier `matrix-9a65b33`.

Validation checklist
- At least 3 successful matrix jobs in a run (Node 14, 16, 18).
- At least 3 artifacts uploaded with prefix `build-9a65b33-`.
- All artifacts contain non-empty content.
- README contains contact email.
